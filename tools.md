Here are a few tools that I've built to improve my Google Analytics workflow. I only create tools that I want to use myself, but I do think that these little utilities will be useful to others, so here they are.

# Prophecise

[Prophecise](https://prophecise.com) is an open source web app that enables analysts and data scientists to quickly build forecast models from their Google Analytics data using a simple UI. It lets userspull reports directly from Google Analytics into the UI for forecasting.

# ML Content Classification for GA

This app scrapes the content from websites using headless-chrome-crawler, runs the content through Google's pre-trained content classification model and then uploads the results to Google Analytics using the Management API.

To set this up, follow the instructions on my [GitHub repo](https://github.com/alsjohnstone/scraper-classification).
