<p><br />
A web app (prophecise.com) that leverages Facebook Prophet to create fast and robust time-series forecasts from your Google Analytics data using a simple UI.</p>

<h1 id="ml-content-classification-for-ga">ML Content Classification for GA</h1>

<p>This app scrapes the content from websites using headless-chrome-crawler, runs the content through Googleâ€™s pre-trained content classification model and then uploads the results to Google Analytics using the Management API.</p>

<p>To set this up, follow the instructions on my <a href="https://github.com/alsjohnstone/scraper-classification">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
