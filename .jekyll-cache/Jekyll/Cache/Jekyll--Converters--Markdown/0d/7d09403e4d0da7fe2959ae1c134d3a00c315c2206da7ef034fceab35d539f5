I"ž<p>Here are a few tools that Iâ€™ve built to improve my Google Analytics workflow. I only create tools that I want to use myself, but I do think that these little utilities will be useful to others, so here they are.</p>

<h1 id="prophecise">Prophecise</h1>

<p><a href="https://prophecise.com">Prophecise</a> is an open source web app that enables analysts and data scientists to quickly build forecast models from their Google Analytics data using a simple UI. It lets userspull reports directly from Google Analytics into the UI for forecasting.</p>

<h1 id="ml-content-classification-for-ga">ML Content Classification for GA</h1>

<p>This app scrapes the content from websites using headless-chrome-crawler, runs the content through Googleâ€™s pre-trained content classification model and then uploads the results to Google Analytics using the Management API.</p>

<p>To set this up, follow the instructions on my <a href="https://github.com/alsjohnstone/scraper-classification">GitHub repo</a>.</p>
