<p>Here’s how you can scrape content from websites using an <a href="https://github.com/yujiosaka/headless-chrome-crawler">open-source web crawler</a> and run the content through Google’s pre-trained content classification model and then uploads the results to Google Analytics using the Google Analytics <a href="https://developers.google.com/analytics/devguides/config/mgmt/v3">Management API</a>. It allows content creators to see patterns and insights based on categories aassigned by Google and enables segmentation of users by reading habits.</p>

<p>Google’s <a href="https://cloud.google.com/natural-language">Natural Language API</a> is one of Google’s machine leaning and AI products. It allows us to derive insights from unstructured text using the same deep machine learning technology that powers both Google Search’s ability to answer specific user questions and the language-understanding system behind Google Assistant, which is pretty cool.</p>
